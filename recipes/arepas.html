    <h1>Arepas</h1>
    <img src="arepas.jpg" height="300" width="300">
    <p>Arepas are round, flat cornmeal cakes originally from **Venezuela and Colombia**, made from **precooked corn flour (masa arepa)** mixed with water and salt. They're cooked on a griddle or baked, and can be **split and filled** with ingredients like cheese, meats, beans, or avocado. Crispy on the outside and soft inside, arepas are enjoyed at any meal and are incredibly versatile.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups precooked white or yellow cornmeal (e.g., P.A.N.)</li>
        <li>2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil or butter (for extra softness)</li>
        <li>cheese, shredded meat, beans, avocado</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix dough: In a bowl, combine 2 cups precooked cornmeal and 1 tsp salt. Slowly add 2½ cups warm water, stirring until a soft dough forms. Let rest 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shape: Divide dough into equal balls, then flatten into discs about ½ inch thick.</li>
        <li>Cook: Heat a lightly oiled skillet or griddle over medium heat. Cook arepas for about 5–7 minutes per side until golden and a crust forms.
